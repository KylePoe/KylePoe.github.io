I am a small town metalhead trying to cope with the overwhelming beauty of the universe while attempting to advance understanding of the brain through mathematics, engineering, and long Python scripts. This page is incomplete at the moment, but check back soon and there should be much more! :)

## Education
I graduated from [West Albany High School](https://wahs.albany.k12.or.us/) in 2015. Over the next five years, I would earn dual degrees in bioengineering (advisor: [Dr. Shelly Gulati](https://engineering.pacific.edu/engineering/directory/gulati-shelly)) and applied mathematics (advisor: [Dr. Aleksei Beltukov](https://www.pacific.edu/campus-directory/aleksei-beltukov)) from [University of the Pacific](https://www.pacific.edu/), having completed a great deal of supplementary coursework in physics and electrical engineering. My first real taste of research was at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, where I participated in the Research Experience for Undergraduates "Discoveries in Bioimaging" advised by [Dr. Brad Sutton](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brad-Sutton). After I was recognized as a Goldwater scholar in 2019 for my research including work done under the supervision of Drs. [Carlos Villalba-Galea](https://pharmacy.pacific.edu/campus-directory/carlos-villalba-galea) and [Rahim Khoie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brad-Sutton), I graduated with highest honors in May of 2020 amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Endeavoring to participate in research at the interface of computational neuroscience, applied mathematics, and neuroengineering, I now am a PhD student in Biomedical Engineering at [Johns Hopkins University](https://www.jhu.edu/), where I am a member of the [Laboratory for Computational Motor Control](http://www.shadmehrlab.org/) advised by [Dr. Reza Shadmehr](http://www.shadmehrlab.org/people_reza-shadmehr), and supplementally mentored by [Dr. Adam Charles](https://www.bme.jhu.edu/ascharles/).
