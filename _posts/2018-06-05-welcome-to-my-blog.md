Hi! My name is Kyle Poe, and this is my blog of things. I will occasionally write things here, from what I am currently studying, to project updates, to tutorials. This is my first blog (and my first time working with Jekyll), and I'm excited to see what I can make of it. I hope you find the contents to be at least somewhat interesting, if not all that useful.
