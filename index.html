	<h1>Hi, my name is Kyle.</h1>
	<p>I am a student of nature and the human condition. 
		A longstanding desire to unite technology with the human mind 
		has led me to the University of the Pacific, where I am currently 
		pursuing BS degrees in Bioelectrical Engineering, Applied Mathematics, 
		and an MS in Engineering Science, concentrating in electrical engineering. 
		My primary areas of research interest are in the modeling of dynamic 
		systems and investigation of possible interfaces between computers and 
		the brain: This past summer, I participated in the REU Discoveries in 
		Bioimaging at the University of Illinois, where I researched the applications 
		of functional connectivity analysis to the diagnosis and tracking of Multiple 
		Sclerosis under Dr. Brad Sutton of the Beckman Institute. I am currently 
		developing an app for the dynamic simulation of electrically active cell 
		behavior.
